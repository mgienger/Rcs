 * \brief The Viewer main class. It is based on the osg::Viewer.
 *
 *        The public API to add and remove nodes etc. is implemented using the
 *        osg event queue. It means that the function call does not directly
 *        take effect, but defers the command to the next event update. This is
 *        for instance important when a removed node has some internal data. You
 *        should not delete this internal data right after removing the node,
 *        since it might still be accessed before the next event traversal is
 *        happening.
 *
 *        A number of keys are associatde with a function if pressed in the
 *        viewer window. These are documented in the KeyCatcherBase and can
 *        be displayed with KeyCatcherBase::printRegisteredKeys():
 *
 *        - Pressing keys 0 - 9 in the viewer window will set the Rcs log
 *          level to the corresponding level
 *        - Pressing F12 will print out to the console all keys that have been
 *          registered with a function.
 *        - Pressing key w will toggle between solid and wireframe display
 *        - Pressing key s will toggle shadows
 *        - Key F10 will toggle full screen mode
 *        - Key F8 will take a screenshot
 *        - Key F9 will start / stop taking screenshort in each frame
 *        - Key M will toggle movie recording (Linux only)
 *        - Key R will toggle the cartoon mode
 *        - LBM while right mouse button is pressed will select the mouse point
 *          as the new rotation center of the mouse manipulator
 *        - Key z will toggle the OpenScenegraph StatsHandler information
 *        - Key Z will print the OpenScenegraph StatsHandler information to
 *          the console
 *
 *        With some older grapics cards, some features such as anti aliasing are
 *        not available. To disable these, there is a constructor with the
 *        options fancy and startupWithShadow that can be set explicitely.
 *        Alternatively, the create function looks for an environment variable
 *        RCSVIEWER_SIMPLEGRAPHICS. If this is set, the viewer starts without
 *        anti aliasing and shadows.
