/*! \brief This class is a factory to create task instances. It works with a
 *         registrar system: Each task that is intended to be constructible
 *         with this factory needs to implement a registrar instance (examples
 *         can be found in many of this libraries tasks). This templated
 *         registrar class registers a task by name with this factory. It also
 *         registers the task's constructor, and a check function that allows
 *         verifying if the task's xml description is specified correctly. The
 *         factory provides methods to then construct tasks by name / xml. In
 *         addition, it provides a static convenience method to construct any
 *         registered task with a string that holds a valid xml description.
 *         For instance:
 *
 *         const char* descr =
 *           "<Task controlVariable=\"XYZ\" effector=\"PowerGrasp_L\" />";
 *
 *         Task* task = TaskFactory::createTask(descr, graph);
 *
 *         This will construct a Position3d task with the given end effector.
 *         How cool isn't it?
